<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Chris, a dedicated and goal-oriented System Administrator with over 12 years experience in 
    managing IT infrastructure, ensuring network and system security, and optimizing system performance. 
    With a strong background in server administration, cloud computing, and automation, 
    I specialize in maintaining reliable and efficient IT environments.</p>
    
<p>Two years ago, I enrolled as a DevOps Engineer online student at Udemy, with focus on bridging the gap 
    between devlopers and operations in organisations. Recently, I enrolled as a web developer online student, 
    also at Udemy, with an objective to understanding the full stack development process. My desire is to 
    contribute my quota in designing and building responsive, user-friendly websites/webapps and crafting 
    seamless digital experiences, using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more.</p>

<p>As a System Administrator, I am passionate about streamlining IT operations, enhancing cybersecurity measures, 
    and implementing automation to improve efficiency. Always eager to learn new technologies, I strive to ensure 
    seamless IT operations that align with business goals. When I'm not coding or working on systems, you'll find 
    me exploring new tech trends or refining my skills through continuous learning.</p>
